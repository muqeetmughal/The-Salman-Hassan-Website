														Hello everybody! My name is <span>Salman Hassan.</span>
														With great adversity, come great opportunities to succeed. When
														you start life at the rock bottom, there is no way to go but up.
														The story of my life is a living proof of that. Growing up in
														the ancient city of Lahore, little did I know that my destiny
														lies elsewhere. For me, the corner of my town was the end of the
														world. Back then, I did not know that I was meant to wander the
														globe and write a destiny for myself that would take me all over
														the world. I was born in the area of Lohari gate Lahore. It is a
														small, quaint and humble neighborhood originally considered a
														home to the blacksmiths of the walled city. I started my
														education from Twinkle Scholars High School which was located
														nearby, in the neighborhood. After my high school graduation, I
														went on to join Government MAO College, Lahore with an infinite
														number of dreams in my eyes. It was then that I realized that
														the world is my oyster. Strangely enough, the vastness of the
														world never bothered me as it would someone who is coming from a
														quaint background as mine. Rather, it fascinated me like no
														other thing. I believe, it was this fascination that motivated
														me enough to work hard and achieve a life that would take me to
														places. With the utmost support of my parents and my siblings,
														especially my brothers, I achieved whatever I desired to. It
														really is the help of my brothers that I was able to make
														something of myself.
														After my college graduation, I traveled to the United States of
														America in pursuit of my dreams. Since then, I have worked in
														the USA, Malaysia, Dubai and Singapore. During the span of my
														work, the main areas of my expertise were Entrepreneurship, Data
														Analysis, Lead Generation and BPO. That led me to the
														development of TMC Pakistan (The Mejor Communications). Ever
														since its creation in 2020, it has only grown in size and
														impact. TMC is my first brainchild, a communications solution
														for entrepreneurs. TMC helps businesses to expand their sales
														through customer care, telemarketing and social media
														management. With TMC's help, budding businesses can expand their
														growth rate by an exponential amount in a short span of time.
														Our social media management services help businesses grow their
														reach and eventually sales numbers go up as well. In a span of
														mere two years, The Mejor Communications has generated tons of
														employment opportunities for the pandemic ridden youth of
														Pakistan. To battle with the worsening job market for 2020
														graduates, we hired extremely capable and experienced graduates
														from the best universities presenting them with the opportunity
														to explore marketing and telecommunications as a career
														opportunity. Through this idea, the experienced graduates and
														clients equally benefited from this arrangement. On one hand,
														the graduates gained a fresh perspective of the work
														environment. Whereas, on the other hand, the clients got to
														experience a diverse, multivalent work force base which is
														passionate to write its own future. As of now, TMC has over 200
														employees working multiple shifts to provide as well a service
														to the clients as they can. At the start of my career, I used to
														work as an insurance agent. The hours were long and the pay was
														minimal. I did not have my own mode of transportation.
														Therefore, in order to get to the office, I used to borrow my
														friend’s bike. For someone who had to borrow a bike to commute
														to his workplace where he once worked as an insurance agent, I
														believe that I have come a long way in my life. I have not only
														made a comfortable and successful life for myself. It gives me
														great pleasure that I am able to do something for the people
														working for me. Because of the hardships I have had to face
														during the struggling phase of my career, I am specifically
														cognizant of my employees who share the same fate as me. I
														constantly try to motivate them to be courageous and wise in
														their decisions. I can never forget the words my first boss told
														me, he said:

														“Fear is the only thing that stops one from succeeding. Once you
														learn to tame that wild horse, success comes easy. Man in his
														very nature is invincible. He just needs to tackle his fears
														head on.”

														I have learned to fight the fear of failure. It does not bother
														me anymore. Failure is an integral part of one’s life story.
														Everything that I have done is due to this fact. Most of the
														employees that work with us show maximum potential for growth
														which gives me great satisfaction. I have been able to build my
														world through the help of my mentors. All the people who taught
														me the value of courage, money and putting your word where you
														thought it. I have learnt a lot from different people around the
														world and it gives me great pleasure to be able to pass on
														everything that I have learnt about the market trends and
														business.
														My career kicked off during my work as an insurance agent.
														Seeing so much death and adversity around me, I was a strong
														believer of insurance as a means to securing financial
														stability. The insurance company I founded was another dream
														project of mine. We are constantly working towards demystifying
														insurance around the globe. I strongly believe that insurance is
														a necessity and not a luxury. Everyone should be access
														insurance and secure their own and their loved ones’ future.
														Slowly, brick by brick, I built a future for myself and my
														family and I want everyone to be able to do it on their own. I
														want everybody to follow where their heart lies. But, I believe
														it is best for them to do it when they have the financial
														security so their loved ones are not rendered helpless.
														Insurance provides you with a risk free ticket to your dreams.
														In many ways, it is really a way to ensure that you end up on a
														path of success.
														Around that same time as I was pursuing a degree in MAO College,
														I also found my knack for arts and culture and immersed myself
														in the world of singing. I believe that music, in itself, is
														healing. Music expresses that which cannot be said and on which
														it is impossible to be silent. My life has taken me all over the
														world. Everywhere, people use different languages to communicate
														with each other. One sound could mean completely different
														things in different languages. One thing I realized during my
														time abroad is that music is one language that binds all of
														humankind. Music is the universal language of mankind. Where
														words fail to describe one’s emotions and feelings, music speaks
														and envelops one’s soul. Music is the language of the spirit. It
														was then that I dreamt of creating a platform for the
														underrepresented musicians of my country. The real, raw talent
														that often goes unnoticed in front of the pomp and show of big
														production houses. Throughout my life, the dream lingered on,
														occupying a permanent spot in my bucket list. At a time when I
														was struggling to make ends meet, the dream seemed distant but I
														was sure that one day I will make it happen. In the year 20.. I
														founded SH Productions, a production company aiming to discover
														the unheard and silenced voices of Pakistan. With SH
														Productions, I dabbled with various genres of music starting
														with folk. Out first track "Asma un Nabi (S.A.W.W) 99 names of
														Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.W)" describes my inner feel for beloved
														prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH). It came straight from my heart
														and described my deepest inner feelings for Prophet Muhammad
														PBUH. There are some words which were rarely used in such
														compositions, but the Divine possession and passion enabled me
														to utter them perfectly. Professional commitment aside, my
														passion lies in the performing arts, music and singing. During
														the process of auditions, I love engaging with the raw talented
														people of Pakistan. They are visionaries, each having a distinct
														voice and artistic qualities. Everything I do enriches my life.
														It amazes me to think that all of the projects and businesses
														that I have today were once dreams envisioned by a seven years
														old sitting outside Twinkle Scholars High School, trying to
														memorize formulas. God has been kind to me.
														Throughout my career, my wife, the love of my life, has been my
														rock. My wife and my kids have been the best support system I
														could ask for. Being a psychologist, my wife has an amazing
														insight into the depth of life. She gives me the best advice to
														deal with employees and any hiccups throughout the year. We got
														married in 2013 and moved to the United States of America in
														2017 with a zeal to do more, seize every opportunity to move
														forward in life. Everyday, we get up and work hard for the two
														blessings God has bestowed upon us. If there is anything that
														you take away from this is that courage, passion and commitment
														to your dreams will take you a long way. My life is a living
														proof that adversity is never a hurdle in the way of success.
														Your background does not define who you are as a person. What
														defines you is your skill, your courage and your resilience in
														the face of fear.
